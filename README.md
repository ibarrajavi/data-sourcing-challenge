# data-sourcing-challenge

This challenge analyzes movie data using two different APIs: NYT & TMDB.

Using the New York Times API reviews are collected from a set start and end date.
More details are then acquired through the Movie Database API using the titles from the reviews.

Dataframes are then merged and data is cleaned for export.
